# express-notetaker

## Description
I was tasked to design an app where the user could create, save, add and delete notes. I used Express, Node.js to create functionality and Heroku to see the deployed site. I was given the front end development so all i had to focus on was connecting it to Express.

This was my first project working with Express and I learned a lot from it. I had to understand the logic on how to connect everything together which took a bit of research and rewatching videos. An aspect which was challenging was planning the structure of the file and making sure that all the npm packages were installed before pushing to Heroku and Github. But after a bunch of trail and error, I was able to make the application work.
